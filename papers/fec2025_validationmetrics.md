# FEC2025 Validation Metrics

## NOTES:
- We need to show: probabilistic comparison of thermocouples to link placement optimisation
- Theme: idea that we never enough experimental data, maximisation of experimental value through data-rich sensors

- Two cases: driven by simulation uncertainty or driven by discrepancy

- Dicuss how we came to the MAVM with epistemic error

## Validation Analysis
In this work, we define validation as the process of determining the degree to which the model represents the true outcome that occurs in the real world. Experimental data is often taken as our best representation of the real world so we have cond

There is a wide variety of approaches for assessing the predictive capability of models [REF]. One approach is to construct a 'validation metric' which is a .
